# CML
This is a repository of <b>c</b>onstrained and <b>m</b>achine-<b>l</b>earned (<b>CML</b>) meta-generalized gradient approximation exchange-correlation functionals developed by the <a href="https://vossgroup.sites.stanford.edu/">Voss group</a> for use in density functional theory simulations.

## MCML
MCML is a multi-purpose exchange-correlation functional optimized for materials science and surface chemistry.<br />
